Effect of Swedish Speed Limits on Accidents
Description
An experiment was performed in Sweden in 1961â€“2 to assess the effect of a speed limit on the motorway accident rate. 
The experiment was conducted on 92 days in each year, matched so that day j in 1962 was comparable to day j in 1961. 
On some days the speed limit was in effect and enforced, while on other days there was no speed limit and cars tended to be driven faster. 
The speed limit days tended to be in contiguous blocks.
